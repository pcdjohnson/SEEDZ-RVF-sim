# SEEDZ-RVF-sim
## Simulating Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission on the livestock movement network in N. Tanzania

This repository will be used for storing outputs and (eventually) code from simulations of Rift Valley fever virus on a network of livestock movements in northern Tanzania. 

A recording of the presentation I gave at the 2020 World One Health Congress:

The presentation slides in PDF format (no animations - the PPT version with the animations is too large for github):

The movement modelling and simulation methods are outlined in this poster presented at the 5th International One Health Congress, Saskatoon, 2018:

Gemma Chaters' poster, also from IOHC2018, describes how social network analysis can be used both to understand the spread of infectious diseases such as RVF and to target interventions:

A disease transmission simulation model using the movement model to trial interventions against infectious disease of livestock is presented in this publication (Chaters et. al, Phil. Trans. B, 2019):
