# SEEDZ-RVF-sim
## Files and code for simulating RVF transmission on the livestock movement network in N. Tanzania

This repository will be used for storing outputs and code from simulations of Rift Valley fever virus on a network of livestock movements in northern Tanzania. 

The movement modelling and simulation methods are outlined in this poster presented at the 5th International One Health Congress, Saskatoon, 2018:

A disease transmission simulation model using the movement model to trial interventions against infectious disease of livestock is presented in this publication (Chaters et. al, Phil. Trans. B, 2019):
